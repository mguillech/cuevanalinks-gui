Introduction
************

Cuevana_ is a (pretty cool) site to watch movies and shows in streaming in 
good quality.

CuevanaLinks *scraps* cuevana to download or retrieve links 
and other information to enjoy contents offline. 

Before :ref:`0.2` it worked as a generator of input 
files (with links of file host services) for Tucan_ or JDownloader_ . 

Now CuevanaLinks can do that part also (handling downloads from Megaupload_)
, allowing a complete "cuevana offline" experience.

.. _config:

The configuration file
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 0.3

Cuevanalinks uses a configuration file named :file:`.cuevanalinks/config.ini` in 
your home directory (:file:`/home/youruser/.cuevanalinks/config.ini` in Unix like 
systems).

By defaults it looks like this::

   [main]
   player = mplayer -fs {file}
   file_format = long

Config options
++++++++++++++

.. envvar:: player 
   
   It's the command when :option:`-p` is used. If the placeholder 
   ``{file}`` is present it's replaced with the filename. If not,
   the filename is appended at the end. 
                                
.. envvar:: file_format

   The  format of the filenames when downloading. Could be 
   ``short`` or ``long`` (see :meth:`Content.filename`)

No other options are used at this stage. 

Last seen episode persistence
------------------------------
.. versionadded:: 0.5

When are following a show, frequently you would want wathc the next episode of
the last one you have seen. If you don't remember which one it was just 
use ``next`` instead the specific episode. 

For example::
 
    $ cuevanalinks -ds 'mad men' next 

Also you could define ``again`` to watch the last one again.
